# Cluster-Research

The implementation of 8 different K-means clustering algorithms contained in 4 functions. Each performs color quantization on a specific image and analyzes the time comparisons between each algorithm. 

Algorithms implemented:
- Unweighted
  - Batch k-means
  - Jancey k-means
  - Batch k-means + TIE
  - Jancey k-means + TIE
- Weighted
  - Batch k-means
  - Jancey k-means
  - Batch k-means + TIE
  - Jancey k-means + TIE
